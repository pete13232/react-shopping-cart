## My process

### Built with

- React (with Vite)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Gained hands-on experience with React's useState for managing and syncing data between the UI and logic.

- Learned how to track and update state in a way that keeps the user interface consistent with the underlying data.

- Practiced organizing components to be reusable, which helps improve scalability and maintainability of the codebase.

### Reflections & Future Improvements

- **Component structure:** Some parts of the UI share overlapping logic or layout but were built separately. With better planning, I could extract those into shared reusable components to reduce repetition and improve maintainability.

- **CSS organization:** Currently, styles are split into separate CSS files for each component. However, some class names are unintentionally reused across components, which may lead to unexpected style overrides. Going forward, I want to implement a more robust naming convention or use CSS Modules to avoid clashes.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp - Front End Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) - This interactive course helped me learn the foundational concepts of React through short lessons and hands-on challenges. The built-in code validation system gives instant feedback, which is really helpful for beginners.
> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The auto-checking system on freeCodeCamp can be very strict. If you're confident your code is correct but it's not passing, consider using tools like ChatGPT to double-check or help debug your solution!
